# opheliagame - landing website 

I have the urge to modify how the landing page of my website looks quite often. Whether I am able to successfully design and implement all these thoughts being a completely different tale, this repository is a home for all such future ideas and experiments. 

Because of wanting to experiment with the landing page a lot more frequently than the actual content on my website will change, two separate repositories help me get rid of all the annoying integration problems like trying to figure out how to make threejs work inside a nextjs project for example. It is an interesting problem to find these solutions but since I have to some extent already done that, I do not want to spend more time facing those deployment and integration issues. Hoping that going forward, this setup will work better for my needs.
